    "# Why NeuroBench?\n",
    "\n",
    "When improving the performance of SNNs execution on hardware you need 3 main components:\n",
    " 1. Information about your **hardware**: What are your bottlenecks? -> Done with hardware details or with **benchmarks**.\n",
    " 2. Information about your **network**: What is the layer that has more of X (input spikes, memory accesses etc)\n",
    " 3. A tool that uses this information to **inform** the **training** procedure and the **hardware deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NeuroBench** covers the second point. It is a hardware agnostic tool to extract relevant metrics from your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - From your hardware, you know the main bottleneck is memory access (synaptic memory reads), in other words, reading the weights\n",
    " - From NeuroBench, you understand the layer that is performing the most memory accesses is layer 3\n",
    " - With this information you can:\n",
    "    - Tune your training procedure to reduce the activation on layer 2\n",
    "    - Prune weights in the layer 2 -> layer 3 matrix\n",
    "    - During deployment, assign more cores to layer 3, so that its computation can be speed up."
